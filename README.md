## Hi, I'm Alex 👋

I’m a QA Engineer with over 5 years of experience in manual testing of web applications. I specialize in ensuring functionality, responsiveness, and user experience for websites built with HTML, WordPress, Elementor, and WooCommerce. My workflow includes creating and executing test cases and checklists, reporting bugs, and performing cross-browser and cross-device testing. I also validate markup-to-HTML conversions and third-party integrations like Mailchimp. With a strong eye for detail and a practical understanding of front-end development, I help deliver high-quality, user-friendly products. I work efficiently within cross-functional teams and use Teamwork to manage tasks, communicate progress, and support agile development processes.

• Created and executed detailed checklists, and testing documentation.
• Reported bugs and worked closely with developers to verify fixes and perform regression testing.
• Conducted cross-browser and cross-device testing to ensure compatibility across platforms.
• Validated responsive layouts and markup-to-HTML conversions for visual and functional accuracy.
• Verified Mailchimp integration and tested email subscription and automation flows.
• Provided ongoing QA support and performed maintenance testing for live websites to catch post-deployment issues.
• Used Teamwork to manage tasks, track progress, and collaborate with cross-functional teams in an agile environment.
