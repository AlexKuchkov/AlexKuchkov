## Hi, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Alex a QA Engineer with over 5 years of experience in manual testing of web applications. I specialize in ensuring functionality, responsiveness, and user experience for websites built with HTML, WordPress, Elementor, and WooCommerce. My workflow includes creating and executing test cases and checklists, reporting bugs, and performing cross-browser and cross-device testing. I also validate markup-to-HTML conversions and third-party integrations like Mailchimp. With a strong eye for detail and a practical understanding of front-end development, I help deliver high-quality, user-friendly products. I work efficiently within cross-functional teams and use Teamwork to manage tasks, communicate progress, and support agile development processes.
