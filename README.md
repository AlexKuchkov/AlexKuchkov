## Hi, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a QA Engineer with over 5 years of experience in manual testing of web applications. I specialize in ensuring functionality, responsiveness, and user experience for websites built with HTML, WordPress, Elementor, and WooCommerce. My workflow includes creating and executing test cases and checklists, reporting bugs, and performing cross-browser and cross-device testing.
